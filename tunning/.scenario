## Scenario setup for Iterated Race (iRace).
############################################################################

## To use the default value of a parameter of iRace, simply do not set
## the parameter (comment it out in this file, and do not give any
## value on the command line).

## Directory where the programs will be run.
execDir = "./"

## Directory where tuning instances are located, either absolute path or
## relative to current directory.
trainInstancesDir = "./instances"

## Indicates the number of decimal places to be considered for the
## real parameters.
digits = 6

## The script called for each configuration that launches the program to be
## tuned.  See templates/target-runner.tmpl
targetRunner = "./target-runner.py"

## The maximum number of runs (invocations of targetRunner) that will
## performed. It determines the (maximum) budget of experiments for the tuning.
maxExperiments = 1000

## Enable/disable deterministic algorithm mode, if enabled irace
## will not use an instance more that once in each race. Note that
## if the number of instances provided is less than firstTest, no
## statistical test will be performed.
deterministic = 1

## Number of calls to targetRunner to execute in parallel. Less than 2
## means calls to targetRunner are sequentially executed.
parallel = 4


## -------------------------------TODO------------------------------------------

## A file containing a list of initial configurations.
## If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
# configurationsFile = ""

## The maximum time in seconds for the runs of targetRunner that will be
## performed. The mean execution time is estimated to calculate the maximum
## number of experiments. When this is used targetRunner must return the
## execution time as second output.
# maxTime = 0

## The percentage of the budget used for estimating the mean execution time.
## Only used when maxTime > 0.
# budgetEstimation = 0.02

## Sample the instances or take them always in the same order.
# sampleInstances = 1

## Specifies the statistical test type: F-test or t-test.
# testType = "F-test"

## Specifies how many instances are seen before the first elimination
## test. It must be a multiple of eachTest.
# firstTest = 5

## Specifies how many instances are seen between elimination tests.
# eachTest = 1

## Enable/disable MPI. Use MPI to execute targetRunner in parallel
## (parameter parallel is the number of slaves).
# mpi = 0

## Enable/disable the soft restart strategy that avoids premature convergence
## of the probabilistic model.
# softRestart = 1

## Confidence level for the elimination test.
# confidence = 0.95

## File containing a list of logical expressions that cannot be true
## for any evaluated configuration. If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
# forbiddenFile = ""

## Enable/disable elitist irace.
# elitist = 1

## Number of instances to add to execution list before previous instances in
## elitist irace.
# elitistNewInstances  = 1

## Limit for the elitist race, number of statistical test performed without
## elimination of configurations.
# elitistLimit  = 2
